Alice has mastered all forms of programming problems, be it identifying a prime number, a perfect number or even a beautiful number.
However, Bob, envious of Alice, challenges her to a new problem which he calls isolated numbers.

Isolated numbers are numbers which **do not** have any digits other than zero appear consecutively throughout them.
Example - ***101001*** is an isolated number whereas ***101101*** is not.

Alice will be given a list of numbers and she has to tell about the status of them as isolated or not for every number on the list.
Can you help Alice in solving the challenge Bob has proposed?
